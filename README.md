## Facial Expression Recognition 
Facial expression recognition is a project focused on developing a sophisticated system that identifies and classifies human emotions through facial expressions, voice, and body language. Traditional emotion detection methods often require extensive manual intervention and are limited in scope. This project aims to enhance the user experience by providing an automated, efficient solution for recognizing emotions in real time. The system leverages advanced machine learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN), to accurately analyze visual and auditory data.

## Features
1. Utilizes advanced CNN and MTCNN algorithms for robust emotion recognition.
2. Real-time processing for immediate feedback and interaction.
3. Supports multiple input sources, including video streams and audio files.
4. High accuracy in emotion classification through comprehensive training datasets.
5. User-friendly interface for seamless interaction and engagement.
## Requirements
1. Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) to ensure compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
2. Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is essential for implementing the emotion detection model.
3. Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow is used for model training and implementation.
4. Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV is crucial for real-time video capture and image processing.
5. IDE: Use of PyCharm or VSCode as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and version control integration.
6. Additional Dependencies: Includes TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, and other libraries necessary for handling deep learning tasks and data processing.
